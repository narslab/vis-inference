  abstract = {Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous success in variety of application domains in the past few years. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and applied in most of the application domains with some new modalities of applications, which helps to open new opportunity. There are different methods have been proposed on different category of learning approaches, which includes supervised, semi-supervised and un-supervised learning. The experimental results show state-of-the-art performance of deep learning over traditional machine learning approaches in the field of Image Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Art, Medical imaging, Medical information processing, Robotics and control, Bio-informatics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Cyber security, and many more. This report presents a brief survey on development of DL approaches, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In addition, we have included recent development of proposed advanced variant DL techniques based on the mentioned DL approaches. Furthermore, DL approaches have explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We have also comprised recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys have published on Deep Learning in Neural Networks [1, 38] and a survey on RL [234]. However, those papers have not discussed the individual advanced techniques for training large scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models [1].},

  abstract = {Up-to-date catalogs of the urban tree population are of importance for municipalities to monitor and improve quality of life in cities. Despite much research on automation of tree mapping, mainly relying on on dedicated airborne LiDAR or hyperspectral campaigns, tree detection and species recognition is still mostly done manually in practice. We present a fully automated tree detection and species recognition pipeline that can process thousands of trees within a few hours using publicly available aerial and street view images of Google MapsTM. These data provide rich information from different viewpoints and at different scales from global tree shapes to bark textures. Our work-flow is built around a supervised classification that automatically learns the most discriminative features from thousands of trees and corresponding, publicly available tree inventory data. In addition, we introduce a change tracker that recognizes changes of individual trees at city-scale, which is essential to keep an urban tree inventory up-to-date. The system takes street-level images of the same tree location at two different times and classifies the type of change (e.g., tree has been removed). Drawing on recent advances in computer vision and machine learning, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) for all classification tasks. We propose the following pipeline: download all available panoramas and overhead images of an area of interest, detect trees per image and combine multi-view detections in a probabilistic framework, adding prior knowledge; recognize fine-grained species of detected trees. In a later, separate module, track trees over time, detect significant changes and classify the type of change. We believe this is the first work to exploit publicly available image data for city-scale street tree detection, species recognition and change tracking, exhaustively over several square kilometers, respectively many thousands of trees. Experiments in the city of Pasadena, California, USA show that we can detect {$>$} 70\% of the street trees, assign correct species to {$>$} 80\% for 40 different species, and correctly detect and classify changes in {$>$} 90\% of the cases.},

  abstract = {Tree species identification using bark images is a challenging problem that could prove useful for many forestry related tasks. However, while the recent progress in deep learning showed impressive results on standard vision problems, a lack of datasets prevented its use on tree bark species classification. In this work, we present, and make publicly available, a novel dataset called BarkNet 1.0 containing more than 23,000 high-resolution bark images from 23 different tree species over a wide range of tree diameters. With it, we demonstrate the feasibility of species recognition through bark images, using deep learning. More specifically, we obtain an accuracy of 93.88\% on single crop, and an accuracy of 97.81\% using a majority voting approach on all of the images of a tree. We also empirically demonstrate that, for a fixed number of images, it is better to maximize the number of tree individuals in the training database, thus directing future data collection efforts.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is important to precision agriculture and the spatial resolution provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is revolutionizing precision agriculture workflows for measurement crop condition and yields over the growing season, for identifying and monitoring weeds and other applications. Monitoring of individual trees for growth, fruit production and pest and disease occurrence remains a high research priority and the delineation of each tree using automated means as an alternative to manual delineation would be useful for long-term farm management. In this paper, we detected citrus and other crop trees from UAV images using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, followed by a classification refinement using superpixels derived from a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The workflow performed well in a relatively complex agricultural environment (multiple targets, multiple size trees and ages, etc.) achieving high accuracy (overall accuracy = 96.24\%, Precision (positive predictive value) = 94.59\%, Recall (sensitivity) = 97.94\%). To our knowledge, this is the first time a CNN has been used with UAV multi-spectral imagery to focus on citrus trees. More of these individual cases are needed to develop standard automated workflows to help agricultural managers better incorporate large volumes of high resolution UAV imagery into agricultural management operations.},

Besides, the recent years have witnessed an impressive progress of deep learning methods for object detection. Motivated by this scenario, we proposed and evaluated the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) high spatial resolution RGB imagery for the detection of law protected tree species. Three state-of-the-art object detection methods were evaluated: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), YOLOv3 and RetinaNet. A dataset was built to assess the selected methods, comprising 392 RBG images captured from August 2018 to February 2019, over a forested urban area in midwest Brazil. The target object is an important tree species threatened by extinction known as Dipteryx alata Vogel (Fabaceae). The experimental analysis delivered average precision around 92\% with an associated processing times below 30 miliseconds.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring analysis is widely used in many different fields of science. Among others, information carried by annual tree rings allows determining the rates of environmental changes and the timing of events. The analysis of the tree rings requires prior detection of tree-ring boundaries which is traditionally performed manually with the use of stereoscope, a moving table, and a data recorder. This is, however, time-consuming and very cumbersome, especially in the case of long tree-ring series. Several approaches to an automatic detection of tree-ring boundaries exist; however, they use basic image processing techniques. As a result, their accuracy is limited, and their application is restricted mainly to conifer wood where the tree-ring boundaries are clearly defined. There also exists some commercial software, however, none of them is perfect as they fail when applied to the ring-porous wood type. Therefore this paper proposes a DeepDendro approach i.e., an automatic tree-ring boundary detector built upon the U-Net convolutional network. To the authors’ best knowledge this is the first study which applies ConvNets for an automatic detection of tree rings. The performance of the existing approach was tested on the dataset of images of wood cores of three species that represent the ring-porous type of the anatomical structure (Quercus sp., Fraxinus excelsior L., and Ulmus sp.). The testing dataset contained over 2500 of tree-ring boundaries, 96\% of which were determined correctly by the proposed method. The corresponding precision is at the level of 0.97 which confirms that only a few false boundaries were introduced by the DeepDendro approach. The results were obtained automatically without any user interaction.},

  abstract = {In this study, we automate tree species classification and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band \&lsquo;Red-Green-Blue\&rsquo; pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points \&gt; 5 m above the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67\&ndash;0.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across \textasciitilde 700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field training data.},

By introducing this hypothesis, a new algorithm with which a multilayered neural network is effectively organized can be deduced. A self-organizing multilayered neural network, which is named “cognitron”, is constructed following this algorithm, and is simulated on a digital computer. Unlike the organization of a usual brain models such as a three-layered perceptron, the self-organization of a cognitron progresses favorably without having a “teacher” which instructs in all particulars how the individual cells respond. After repetitive presentations of several stimulus patterns, the cognitron is self-organized in such a way that the receptive fields of the cells become relatively larger in a deeper layer. Each cell in the final layer integrates the information from whole parts of the first layer and selectively responds to a specific stimulus pattern or a feature.},

The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

  abstract = {A neural network model, called a “neocognitron”, is proposed for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition. It is demonstrated by computer simulation that the neocognitron has characteristics similar to those of visual systems of vertebrates.The neocognitron is a multilayered network consisting of a cascade connection of many layers of cells, and the efficiencies of the synaptic connections between cells are modifiable. Self-organization of the network progresses by means of “learning-without-a-teacher” process: Only repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns is necessary for the self-organization of the network, and no information about the categories to which these patterns should be classified is needed. The neocognitron by itself acquires the ability to classify and correctly recognize these patterns according to the differences in their shapes: Any patterns which we human beings judge to be alike are also judged to be of the same category by the neocognitron. The neocognitron recognizes stimulus patterns correctly without being affected by shifts in position or even by considerable distortions in shape of the stimulus patterns. If a stimulus pattern is presented at a different position or if the shape of the pattern is distorted, the responses of the cells in the intermediate layers, especially the ones near the input layer, vary with the shift in position or the distortion in shape of the pattern. However, the deeper the layer is, the smaller become the variations in cellular responses. Thus, the cells of the deepest layer of the network are not affected by the shift in position or the distortion in shape of the stimulus pattern.},

  abstract = {A neural network model for visual pattern recognition, called the “neocognitron,” was previously proposed by the author. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of the model in detail. In order to demonstrate the ability of the neocognitron, we also discuss a pattern-recognition system which works with the mechanism of the neocognitron. The system has been implemented on a minicomputer and has been trained to recognize handwritten numerals. The neocognitron is a hierarchical network consisting of many layers of cells, and has variable connections between the cells in adjoining layers. It can acquire the ability to recognize patterns by learning, and can be trained to recognize any set of patterns. After finishing the process of learning, pattern recognition is performed on the basis of similarity in shape between patterns, and is not affected by deformation, nor by changes in size, nor by shifts in the position of the input patterns. In the hierarchical network of the neocognitron, local features of the input pattern are extracted by the cells of a lower stage, and they are gradually integrated into more global features. Finally, each cell of the highest stage integrates all the information of the input pattern, and responds only to one specific pattern. Thus, the response of the cells of the highest stage shows the final result of the pattern-recognition of the network. During this process of extracting and integrating features, errors in the relative position of local features are gradually tolerated. The operation of tolerating positional error a little at a time at each stage, rather than all in one step, plays an important role in endowing the network with an ability to recognize even distorted patterns.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests concentrate the largest diversity of species on the planet and play a key role in maintaining environmental processes. Due to the importance of those forests, there is growing interest in mapping their components and getting information at an individual tree level to conduct reliable satellite-based forest inventory for biomass and species distribution qualification. Individual tree crown information could be manually gathered from high resolution satellite images; however, to achieve this task at large-scale, an algorithm to identify and delineate each tree crown individually, with high accuracy, is a prerequisite. In this study, we propose the application of a convolutional neural network\&mdash;Mask R-CNN algorithm\&mdash;to perform the tree crown detection and delineation. The algorithm uses very high-resolution satellite images from tropical forests. The results obtained are promising\&mdash;the     R e c a l l    ,     P r e c i s i o n    , and     F 1     score values obtained were were     0.81    ,     0.91    , and     0.86    , respectively. In the study site, the total of tree crowns delineated was     59,062    . These results suggest that this algorithm can be used to assist the planning and conduction of forest inventories. As the algorithm is based on a Deep Learning approach, it can be systematically trained and used for other regions.},

We show that the degrees of freedom in these models are related to the expected optimism, which is the expected difference between test error and training error. We provide an efficient Monte-Carlo method to estimate the degrees of freedom for multi-class classification methods. We show that the degrees of freedom is less than the parameter count in a simple XOR network. We extend these results to neural nets trained on synthetic and real data and investigate the impact of network’s architecture and different regularization choices. The degrees of freedom in deep networks is dramatically less than the number of parameters. In some real datasets, the number of parameters is several orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom. Further, we observe that for fixed number of parameters, deeper networks have less degrees of freedom exhibiting a regularization-by-depth. Finally, we show that the degrees of freedom of deep neural networks can be used in a model selection criterion. This criterion has comparable performance to crossvalidation with lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {Others have reported that instances where trees grow into lines rarely result in power outages. The vast majority of tree-related outages stem from tree failure, particularly if outages during severe weather events are included. Generally, tree–conductor conflicts resulting from tree failure are classified as unpreventable because the trees are located outside the right-of-way. In the emerging competitive environment, utilities will require a means of decreasing so-called unpreventable outages. The primary locations for unpreventable outages are areas where lines run adjacent to or through natural forest tree stands. Tree mortality exposes a power line to a high risk of tree incidents over time. The risk to the line is directly related to the number of trees within striking distance of the line. Conventional clear widths leave a substantial residual tree risk. Hazard tree removal programs do not provide enduring reliability gains. A new mathematical model, the optimal clear width calculator, is used to assess the tree risk over variable clear widths and line heights. The risk ratings in the output line strike probability charts permit quantitative comparisons of construction and maintenance options. The line strike probability chart indicates that there is a point of diminishing return in line security for dollars invested in additional clear width.},

The models are based on an extensive data set from Duke Power, a company in the southeastern U.S., and the models used are a negative binomial generalized linear model and a Poisson generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The results show that: 1) increasing tree trimming frequency does lead to a decrease in the number of outages on the electric power distribution system; 2) the effects of tree trimming on different circuits can be differentiated and measured; and 3) the Poisson GLMM provides a good fit to the data in this situation. In particular, the results of the model show that for the Duke Power system, one would have expected, on average, 0.9 fewer outages per circuit over the 43-month data recording period if the time between tree trimming cycles was decreased by 1 yr across the whole system. These models could be applied to other power systems, and the results should be useful for power managers in setting tree trimming frequencies and in focusing on the most frequent trimming efforts on those circuits for which trimming will have the greatest benefit.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

  abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded. 2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent. 3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other. 4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven. 5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

  abstract = {Realistically predicting earthquake is critical for seismic risk assessment, prevention and safe design of major structures. Due to the complex nature of seismic events, it is challengeable to efficiently identify the earthquake response and extract indicative features from the continuously detected seismic data. These challenges severely impact the performance of traditional seismic prediction models and obstacle the development of seismology in general. Taking their advantages in data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been utilized as powerful statistical tools to tackle these issues. This typically involves processing massive detected data with severe noise to enhance the seismic performance of structures. From extracting meaningful sensing data to unveiling seismic events that are below the detection level, AI assists in identifying unknown features to more accurately predicting the earthquake activities. In this focus paper, we provide an overview of the recent AI studies in seismology and evaluate the performance of the major AI techniques including machine learning and deep learning in seismic data analysis. Furthermore, we envision the future direction of the AI methods in earthquake engineering which will involve deep learning-enhanced seismology in an internet-of-things (IoT) platform.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the effectiveness of an enhanced tree trimming (ETT) program for its ability to reduce tree-related power outages, and thereby improve resilience, on an electric utility distribution system during storm events. Evaluations encompassed thirteen years of trimming (i.e. 2005–2017) data and were performed for both backbone and lateral utility lines. Backbones included all three phase lines between a substation and a faultable device whereas all other lines were considered laterals. The study site spanned the entire state of Connecticut, where the dominant vegetation is temperate deciduous forest. We controlled for variations in weather, tree cover, and wire type, by pairing ETT-treated zones with nearby untreated zones. ETT-treated conductors had storm outage rates that were 0.07–0.36 outages/km/year lower than untreated conductors or 35–180\% lower than the service-area's average annual outage rate for untreated conductors. ETT-treatment was associated with lower outage rates for “minor” outage types (i.e., blown fuse, tripped recloser, etc.) but the treatment effect was not statistically significant for “major” outage types (damaged poles or wires). System-wide ETT application, for the approximately 27,000 km of conductors in the study area, was predicted to reduce annual storm-related outages by an average of 81–104 and 318–759 outages/year for backbone and lateral lines, respectively. Our study provided a robust empirical evaluation of ETT and also proposes a geospatial methodology that controls for variations in weather and environment.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be an efficient alternative approach to classical modeling techniques. AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.},

As compared to the F-CNN model trained using full images, S-CNN model trained using segmented images more than doubles in performance to 98.6\% accuracy when tested on independent data previously unseen by the models even with 10 disease classes. Not only this, by using tomato plant and target spot disease type as an example, we show that the confidence of self-classification for S-CNN model improves significantly over F-CNN model.

  abstract = {In 1995, Eastern Utilities was among 14 utilities in the United States and Canada participating in a study to collect and evaluate data about the phenomena of how trees cause outages. Results indicate that failure of trees accounted for 40\% of the preventable tree-caused outages in the Brockton territory of Eastern Utilities. Even though line clearance tree trimming continues to be the primary strategy, programmatic changes were made in Eastern Utilities\&\#39; Tree Management Program. A Danger Tree Project was initiated to identify and mitigate trees with structural weaknesses along the 3-phase portion of the electrical distribution circuits. Approximately 4\% of the trees in the portion of the urban forest managed by Eastern Utilities will either be removed or stormproof pruned. Reliability has improved by 20\% to 30\% along the circuits where hazardous trees have been removed or storm-proof pruning has been done. Proactive communication within the community and participation in communitybased tree planting has accompanied this project. Electric utilities trim trees to minimize treecaused electrical outages. (Outages are the interruption of electrical service to customers.) Typically, the expense to trim trees is a significant percentage of the maintenance budget of an electric utility. In spite of this expenditure, trees continue to be the greatest single cause of outages for many electric utilities. To minimize tree-caused outages, maintaining clearance between tree growth and energized conductors is the strategy for most utility tree management programs. Yet the phenomenon of tree-caused outages has not been empirically researched. In 1995, 14 utilities in the United States and Canada subscribed to the Tree-Caused Interruption Research Project conducted by Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI). The outage study consisted of a survey to collect and analyze data about individual tree-related outage events. The goal of the study was to develop regional and overall databases to identify and analyze the factors involved with tree-related outages. Eastern Utilities was a participant in the study. Results of the study led to programmatic adjustments in Eastern Utilities\&\#39; approach to tree management, consisting of a modification of practices for line clearance tree trimming and initiating a Danger Tree Mitigation Project. These changes were based on the study\&\#39;s cumulative analysis for all participants, a study analysis specific to Eastern Utilities, a survey of the tree population adjacent to primary electrical circuits in one of Eastern Utilities\&\#39; service territories, and a review of the outage history from trees at Eastern Utilities for the years 1989 to 1994. Methods The study was designed to collect data on 22 factors that describe the conditions of a treerelated electrical outage. A standardized data collection form was designed by ECI with input from the participants of the study. Data compilation and analysis was done by the ECI staff. Eastern Utilities also conducted a survey of the urban forest adjacent to the primary electrical circuits of the distribution network in its Brockton service territory and reviewed the outage history from 1989 to 1994. The primary electrical circuits consist of pole spans with single and multiple electrical conductors, called phases. The survey was designed to locate trees on the 3-phase portions of these circuits with the characteristics that are most likely to cause an outage. Also, an outage history of the primary circuits was reviewed to identify areas that have been historically prone to treecaused outages. Data collected for outage study. The study was organized to collect data on tree-caused outages by the following 6 categories: 1. cause of the outage 2. characteristics of the tree 3. surrounding environment 4. orientation of tree to electrical conductor 118 Simpson and Van Bossuyt: Tree-Caused Outages 5. weather conditions at the time that the outage occurred 6. components and design of the electrical system at the site of the outage. In addition, the arborist assessed whether the outage was preventable or nonpreventable. This assessment was based on whether the tree would still have caused the outage after the normal cycle of line clearance trimming was done. For instance, if a tree with adequate clearance and no apparent indicators of structural weakness fails during a sunny winter day with 25 mile per hour winds, it was considered nonpreventable. The categories describing the cause of the outage were broken down into growth or failure. The 3 growth-related indicators are top growth, side growth, or bending limb. Tree failures were matched with a choice of 6 descriptors. The type of contact made between the energized conductor and tree, such as tree to conductor or tree broke conductor, was recorded. Characteristics of the tree classify typical physical features of the tree such as size and species. The condition of the tree that failed has 14 subcategories that describe the apparent structural defect (or lack of) that probably resulted in an outage. Also, the last time the tree was trimmed, if ever, and the technique used was logged. Information about the surrounding environment, orientation of the tree to the electrical conductor, and weather conditions at the time the outage occurred was collected. These factors describe the conditions that likely triggered a treecaused outage event. The data about wind conditions were categorized using the Beaufort Scale and orientation of the tree to the electrical conductor. The weather was classified by 10 general descriptions. The type of construction and type of conductor at the site of an outage were recorded. Six data were collected that depict the electrical engineering portion of the outage event. The factors are 1. protective device, such as fuses 2. construction type, such as armless, vertical, spacer cable, and crossarm 3. conductor type 4. conductor size 5. line voltage 6. number of phases involved. Tree population survey. A survey of the tree population was conducted in the Brockton territory of the Eastern Utilities system. The territory consists of 17 communities and covers approximately 300 square miles. The objective of the survey was to locate trees with the characteristics that present the greatest risk from failure to the 3phase portion of the distribution circuits. The survey was a simple random sample of 40\% of the number of pole spans for the 3-phase portion of the primary electrical circuits. Random pole spans were selected on a map of primary circuits and the characteristics of the trees within those pole spans were categorized. The trees were categorized along the following 6 indicators of their potential to cause an outage from failure: 1. no predictor of potential failure 2. visible structural defect 3. overhanging limbs 4. weak species 5. white pines with co-dominant stems 6. no potential low growing species.},

This paper provides an overview of recent advances in computer vision techniques as they apply to the problem of civil infrastructure condition assessment. In particular, relevant research in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and structural engineering is presented. The work reviewed is classified into two types: inspection applications and monitoring applications. The inspection applications reviewed include identifying context such as structural components, characterizing local and global visible damage, and detecting changes from a reference image. The monitoring applications discussed include static measurement of strain and displacement, as well as dynamic measurement of displacement for modal analysis. Subsequently, some of the key challenges that persist toward the goal of automated vision-based civil infrastructure and monitoring are presented. The paper concludes with ongoing work aimed at addressing some of these stated challenges.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5\% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6\% error on the test set) and 17.3\% top-1 error on the validation set.},

  abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},

  abstract = {Data-augmentation is key to the training of neural networks for image classification. This paper first shows that existing augmentations induce a significant discrepancy between the size of the objects seen by the classifier at train and test time: in fact, a lower train resolution improves the classification at test time! We then propose a simple strategy to optimize the classifier performance, that employs different train and test resolutions. It relies on a computationally cheap fine-tuning of the network at the test resolution. This enables training strong classifiers using small training images, and therefore significantly reduce the training time. For instance, we obtain 77.1\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet50 trained on 128⇥128 images, and 79.8\% with one trained at 224⇥224.},

Specifically, artificial neural networks are mainly studied, which mainly include Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Among these networks, CNNs got the most attention due to the kernel methods with the weight sharing mechanism, and achieved state-of-the-art in many domains, especially computer vision. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive survey related to the recent improvements in CNNs, and we demonstrate these advances from the low level to the high level, including the convolution operations, convolutional layers, architecture design, loss functions, and advanced applications.},

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},
